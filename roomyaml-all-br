commanddescriptions:
 use: Use this with an object in the room, like "/use book" to read it. If you want to /do/ something with an object try /use even if doesn’t make sense. For example, say "/use cookie" to eat a cookie. If you had a cookie. But you don't. Mmm... a cookie sounds good about now, doesn't it?
 talk: See what {friendname} is thinking right now. You could talk to a wall, but they seldom have much to say in response. To talk to other people playing with you, simply type without a / in front. Everyone in the room will see your message.
 get: Pick up an object. You’ll have to /get cookie before you can /use cookie.
 drop: Drop an item you have picked up, eg, /drop chair to drop the chair you are holding, or /drop microphone to drop a microphone
 kick: Kick something, eg, /kick wall to break your toes, or /kick ball to boot the ball across the room
 go: Move in the direction specified, such as "/go n" to move north. This is always relative to the center of the room. You do not have to move back to go another direction. You can think of it like "/examine direction", which may reveal to you more than you see with a simple /look or /examine.
 examine: Used alone, this will look around the room and tell you what you see. Sometimes you will see things differently if you look around again. And perhaps again and again. Used with an object in the room ("/examine book") will take a closer look at that thing.
 exits: Will tell you where you see ways out of the room. Too bad you’re trapped in a basement without many of them.

commands:
  - name: help
    actions:
      - user: There are a few commands that will help you get out of this basement. Remember to always type a '/' in front of the command and use simple phrases.

And perhaps again and again. Used with an object in the room ("/examine book") will take a closer look at that thing.\n\n /use - Use this with an object in the room, like "/use book" to read it.
